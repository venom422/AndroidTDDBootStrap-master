An Android TDD bootstrap project, using a collection of new technology, obeying the best practices, inspired by some popular architectures, and developed with many handy tools.

## Project structure

![](https://imgs.piasy.com/2018-03-08-AndroidTDDBookStrap_module_structure.png)

+  `base` is the so called architecture part, and base classes, best practice, etc.
+  Package organization
  +  Package by layer v.s. package by feature, read more about the [Package organization part of this blog](http://fernandocejas.com/2015/07/18/architecting-android-the-evolution/), and [Package by feature, not layer](http://www.javapractices.com/topic/TopicAction.do?Id=205).
  +  Both features and models are packaged by their functions. `users` and `repos` are model modules, each one provides a `Repo` API for upper level modules. `splash` and `trending` are feature modules, each one is a standalone module, implementing a single feature.
  +  All modules can be composed together as a full APK, containing all features.
+  Module organization
  +  Modules are organized by contributors in the `contrib` dir, that can separate code and responsibility as much as possible. Because each person has his own style and flavor, others should obey the style of contributor in each module, that's a very clear rule.
  +  Feature modules are 100% decomposed, that makes each feature module as lightweight as possible, and activity is launched through string url.
+  `business` contains app specific business code, configurations, etc.
+  `bridge` module is just like a bridge, connecting modules together, like the image above.

## Build tips
+  Sign key config
  +  Place KeyStore file in some place, and create a TemplateKeyStore.properties, and config the KeyStore in it, include `keystore`, `keystore.password`, `key.password`, `key.alias`.
+  To clone all submodules, please use `git clone --recursive git@github.com:Piasy/AndroidTDDBootStrap.git`
+  use flavor to control server configuration, use build type to control log behavior
  +  `dev` for development server, `prod` for production server
  +  `debug` enable log and dev tools, disable crash and analytics, `release` against it

## Why another bootstrap project?
From the beginning of the year 2015, our team started a new project, and before we developing functionality in detail, we have tried to create a well-architected project from scratch, with well designed network layer, data layer, asynchronous execution, communication between modules, and last but not least: unit test and integrated testing support. After several months of development, we found some drawbacks of our current architecture, and also found some popular architectures, then I decided to extract our original well designed architecture and make it open-source, with amendment according to the drawbacks and features from the new popular architectures we've found.
Recently I have seen a lot of bootstrap/base Android projects, including [JakeWharton's u2020](https://github.com/JakeWharton/u2020), [mobiwiseco's Android-Base-Project](https://github.com/mobiwiseco/Android-Base-Project), etc, but none of these projects cover all the features I include in this AndroidTDDBootStrap project. That's why I want more people to see this repo, and I also want get feedback from more people to improve this project.

## Architecture
Based on the project architecture I'm currently working on, [YOLO](https://www.yoloyolo.tv/), and inspired by popular architectures: [Android Clean Architecture](https://github.com/android10/Android-CleanArchitecture), [Against Android Unit Tests: The Square way](http://www.philosophicalhacker.com/2015/04/10/against-android-unit-tests/).

## Dev tips
+  Create a new contrib module: `./new_contrib_module.sh contrib/<contributor name>/<module name>`
+  Compose all modules together: `./install_app.sh <build type>`
+  Buck build for each feature module: `./install_buck.sh contrib/piasy/trending` or `./install_buck.sh app`
+  You can also click the `run` button of AndroidStudio for each feature module, but it doesn't work for app module.
+  Create Activity
  +  **TODO** use the MVP feature generator
+  Unit test
  +  use the check*.sh script in buildsystem dir
+  Run `./buildsystem/ci.sh` before git push.

## Todo
+  [x] CheckStyle
+  [ ] MVP source generator plugin
+  [ ] Espresso test
+  [ ] exopackage for each feature module
+  [ ] try MVVM
+  [ ] try React Native
+  [ ] try Kotlin
